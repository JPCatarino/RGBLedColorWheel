# Color Wheel for RGB LED

I'm learning Arduino and I wanted to practice serial communication. Inspired by chapter 7 of Make: Getting Started With Arduino, I've decided to create a (really) simple color wheel app to change the color of a RGB LED. This is my first project so don't expect much :)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this app, you'll need, at least:

```
1 Arduino Uno Rev3 
1 RGB LED
1 button
1 10kOhm Resistor
1 220Ohm Resistor
1 Breadboard
All the wire you feel like using
```

### Usage
Build the circuit. Upload the Arduino sketch to your microcontroller, and then execute the Processing sketch. Click around the wheel, hope it does change into the chosen color, smile, move on.

## Circuit Example
This is how i built the circuit, but you may find a better way.

## Known Bugs
LED doesn't light up exactly with the chosen color (but somewhat close).

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)
