# Color Wheel for RGB LED

I'm learning Arduino and I wanted to practice serial communication. Inspired by chapter 7 of Make: Getting Started With Arduino, I've decided to create a simple color wheel app to change the color of a RGB LED.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this app, you'll need, at least:

```
A Arduino Uno Rev3 
A RGB LED
```

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) 
* [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* [ControlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/)
